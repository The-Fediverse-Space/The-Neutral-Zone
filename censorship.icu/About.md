### About Us

There is no limit to the topics appearing in Censorship.ICU. National security and geopolitics in all its dimensions — strategic, economic, diplomatic, and military — are emphasized. The right to exist and the survival of the State of Israel is of great importance to us. Business, science, technology, medicine, management, and economics in their practical and ethical dimensions are also emphasized, as is the state of American culture.
